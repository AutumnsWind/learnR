# Why R?

R stands out from many statistical software with the following reasons:

#### It's free

R is totally free. You don't need to buy a license to use R so that there is no financial entry barrier to use it and its extension packages. 

#### It's open-source

R and most of the packages are fully open-source. Thousands of users and developers are constantly reviewing the source code of the packages to see whether there are bugs to fix or things to improve. If you encounter exceptions, you can even dig into the source code, find where the problem is, and may contribute to fixing it.

#### It's popular

R is very popular, if not the most, statistical programming language and platform to perform data mining, analysis, and visualization. High popularity often means easier communication between you and other users because you "speak" the same language.

#### It's flexible

R is a carefully designed dynamic script language. It is highly flexible to allow programming styles of multiple paradigms like object-oriented programming, functionality programming, meta programming, and etc. Its flexibility enables you to write robust code to perform a wide range of data operations.

#### It's reproducible

When using software based on graphical user interface, you only need to choose from menus and click buttons. However, it is hard to accurately reproduce what you have done automatically without writing scripts. 

In most scientific research areas and many industrial applications, reproducibility is necessary for many reasons. R scripts can precisely describe what you do with the computing environment and thus is fully reproducible.

#### It has rich resources

R has a huge, rapidly increasing amount of online resources. In addition to more than 5,600 packages in almost all data-related areas, there are a great number of authors who regularly write personal blogs and [stackoverflow answers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) and share their thoughts, experiences, and best practices. Also there are a lot of websites specialized in R like [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/), and [Rdocumentation](http://www.rdocumentation.org/).

#### It has strong community

The community of R consists of not only R developers but also, in its major part, R users from a wide range of backgrounds like statistics, econometrics, finance, bioinfomatics, mechanical engineering, physics, medicine, and so on.

A great number of R users and developers actively contribute to the open-source projects or packages written in R. The goal of the community is to make data analysis, exploration, and visualiztion easier and more interesting.

If you have any problems using R, just google what puzzles your mind, there are probably already some answers to your question. If not, just issue a question on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com), you will get response in a very short time.

#### It's cutting-edge

Many R users are professional researchers in statistics, econometrics, or other disciplines. It is more often that an author publishes his or her new paper along with a new package that includes the cutting-edge techniques presented in the paper. Maybe it's a new statistical test, a pattern recognition method, or a better-tuned optimization algorithm. 

No matter what it is, R community has the previledge to be early, if not the first, to apply cutting-edge data-science knowledge in real world, improve its functionality, and reveal its potentials.
